The AI engineer successfully transformed an MVP aircraft review site into a professional, live platform (FlightSimSpot.com). Initial work focused on UI/UX improvements: converting aircraft details from modals to full-page views, implementing multiple image support, and enabling archive/restore functionality. Authentication issues (Google OAuth origin mismatch, session cookie problems) were resolved. UI enhancements included a persistent, Flightsim.to-style header with search, a Top 10 section, and homepage improvements like Recently Added Aircraft. A crucial page view tracking system was integrated backend-to-frontend. A major database issue—data loss on deployment—was fixed. The current work involves implementing multiple admin features: review deletion, features/tags editing, a comprehensive admin dashboard (currently showing zeroed data needing a fix), a dynamic Categories dropdown, and adding compatibility editing to aircraft forms, which is the immediate focus.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a comprehensive website to collate paid and freeware aircraft reviews for MS2024/MS2020. Aircraft must be grouped by Category (Commercial, GA, Military, Helicopters), Real Manufacturer, and Simulation Developer, with variants. Users must log in (Google prioritized) to write 5-star reviews with detailed categories. Admin users () need full capabilities: adding new aircraft via a full-page form, editing existing details, archiving/restoring aircraft, and managing multiple images. The platform should offer filtering, sortable lists, user profiles, and professional imagery. Implemented features include the 3-level hierarchy, functional Google OAuth, admin adding/editing/archiving, multiple image support (backend), full-page aircraft details (frontend), a Flightsim.to-style navigation header with search and Top 10 view, Recently Added aircraft on homepage, basic page view tracking (Most Viewed, Trending), and a View All page. Critical fixes include OAuth origin, frontend blank page, session issues, and preventing database resets on deployment. The site has been rebranded to FlightSimSpot to future-proof for scenery and hardware reviews.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete implementation of Compatibility field editing (MSFS 2020/2024) in the Add/Edit Aircraft forms.
-   Fix the Admin Dashboard to display correct user, aircraft, and review statistics (currently showing 0s).
-   Make the Edit Welcome Message feature fully functional, including saving the updated text to the database.
-   Implement drag/drop image upload functionality for aircraft (current backend supports multiple images, but frontend UI for upload is pending).
-   Implement external data sourcing/scraping (e.g., FlightSim.to downloads, SimMarket sales) for alternative ranking metrics.

<current_work>
The application, FlightSimSpot, is a live, production-ready aircraft review platform. It has a React frontend on Vercel and a FastAPI backend on Railway, using MongoDB Atlas. A critical fix for data loss on deployment has been implemented, ensuring existing data is preserved. Automated local backups are set up via . Google Analytics is integrated for visitor tracking.

The immediate work is focused on implementing significant administrative and UI enhancements:
1.  **Admin Review Deletion**: Backend support for deleting reviews is ready.
2.  **Features/Tags System**: Integrated into add/edit aircraft forms, allowing comma-separated tags and displaying them as badges.
3.  **Admin Dashboard**: A new admin panel is in place, but it's currently displaying 0 for all statistics (users, aircraft, reviews). The AI engineer is debugging this, suspecting backend collection name mismatches in  and has made initial fixes.
4.  **Categories Dropdown Navigation**: The header now features a scalable Categories dropdown menu, replacing the previous horizontal links.
5.  **Text Correction**: X simulations available has been globally updated to X aircraft available.
6.  **Welcome Message Editor**: An admin-only Edit Welcome Message button and modal are implemented on the homepage, allowing admins to modify the site's introductory text (persistence to database is a pending task).
7.  **Compatibility Editing**: The AI engineer is currently in the process of adding MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024 compatibility fields to the Add New Aircraft form, having already addressed it for the Edit Aircraft form. The trajectory ends with the AI engineer searching for the correct location to implement this.

<optional_next_step>
Complete the implementation of the Compatibility field in the Add New Aircraft form, and then verify the Admin Dashboard statistics are correctly displayed after the backend fix.
